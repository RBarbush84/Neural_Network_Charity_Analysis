# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to build a neural network model to predict how Alphabet Soup can make the most impactful positive donations to different organizations, and which organizations Alphabet Soup helps fund will be the most beneficial to donate to.

## Results
### Data Preprocessing
- The IS_SUCCESSFUL variable was the target of this model, to determine if donations made by Alphabet Soup were successful.
- The variables that were features to try to predict if donations are successful were APPLICATION_TYPE, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS and ASK_AMT.
- The EIN and NAME variables were neither targets nor features of the model and were dropped from the input data.

### Compiling, Training and Evaluating the Model
- how many neurons, layers and activation functions used in the model
- able to achieve 75% target performance
- steps to try to increase model performance

## Summary
summarize results and provide recommendation (how a different model could help solve the problem)
