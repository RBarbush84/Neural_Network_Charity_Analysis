# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to build a neural network model to predict how Alphabet Soup can make the most impactful positive donations to different organizations, and which organizations Alphabet Soup helps fund will be the most beneficial to donate to.

## Results
### Data Preprocessing
- what variables are considered targets for the model
- what variable are features of the model
- what variables are not targets or features and should be removed

### Compiling, Training and Evaluating the Model
- how many neurons, layers and activation functions used in the model
- able to achieve 75% target performance
- steps to try to increase model performance

## Summary
summarize results and provide recommendation (how a different model could help solve the problem)
